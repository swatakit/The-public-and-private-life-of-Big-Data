0|59|ADVANC|9232014|Active funds caught out by Thai post-coup rally, retail buyers profit|"BANGKOK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Fund managers in Thailand hired to beat the stock market have been caught flat footed by a 12 percent rally in the main index since a military coup in May.Retail investors jumped onto the rally and even passive funds that simply track the main index have outperformed so-called actively traded funds - leaving many fund managers having to explain to their investors where they took a wrong turn.While the stock market's main benchmark, the Stock Exchange of Thailand index .SETI, has risen 20.9 percent so far this year, the passive SCB SET Index Fund SCBSETu.BK has gained more than 23 percent, when dividend payouts are factored in.That is almost double the 12 percent gain of the managed Bualuang Top-Ten Fund (BTP), the best performing fund in 2012 and among the outperformers last year.The returns of actively managed funds such as BTP will likely lag passive index trackers and retail investors in 2014, market sources say.""Most fund managers have missed the train because of the unexpected rally of the Thai stock market after the coup,"" said Yernyong Thepjumnong, the equities fund manager of Krungthai Asset Management, who helps manage 471 billion baht ($14.6 billion) of assets.""It's easier for retail investors to reposition quickly.For big funds like us, we cannot make that swift a change.We have allocated more to less risky banking and consumer stocks and that has helped improve our fund performance but we still need to have positions in those (energy and telecom) big sectors.""In the months before the coup, when the government was undermined by protests in the streets of Bangkok, managed funds bought into sectors such as telecommunications and energy as part of a defensive strategy aimed at weathering uncertainty and a deteriorating economy.But military leaders quickly targeted these sectors for reform.The risk that reforms would hurt earnings caused some of the country's biggest blue-chip companies to underperform.Managed funds were too slow to exit energy and telecos and to buy into the small- and mid-cap stocks that rallied the most.Thai stocks did not sell off as sharply as in previous coups, and they rebounded as the junta's plans to tackle economic problems and boost consumption were seen as positive.Thai equities are now Southeast Asia's top performers.Year-to-date gains of passively managed index mutual funds, which mirror market indexes, have outperformed actively managed funds.Of the 117 open-ended equity mutual funds tracked by the Association of Investment Management Companies (AIMC), 47 have outperformed the SET's 20.9 percent gain so far this year.This includes all of Thailand's passive funds and a few actively managed ones such as SCB SET Banking Sector Fund with a gain of 38 percent.The remaining 70 funds, the majority of which are actively managed funds, underperformed the SET.Actively managed funds say they seek outperformance in the long term and short-term fluctuations are part of the process of achieving this objective.""We invest in companies who are market leaders with sustained competitive advantage and quality management at an attractive valuation, and would hold until the intrinsic values are realised,"" said Sudarat Tippayaterdtana, fund manager of BTP and head of the mutual equity fund of BBL Asset Management.But managed fund favourites such as the country's biggest mobile phone operator Advanced Info Service ADVANC.BK and its shareholder Intouch Holdings INTUCH.BK have struggled.Both have fallen 10 percent since the coup after the military suspended a 4G licence auction pending reforms to the telecommunications regulator and an auction review.The government's energy reforms have dented energy firms such as PTT Exploration and Production PTTEP.BK, with stock price gains of 4.1 percent smaller than those of the market.Gains in small- and mid-cap firms have fuelled the wider SET rally but many of these are too small to meet the restrictions placed on what large funds can invest in.Foreign investors, spooked first by the political turmoil and then by military rule, also missed out on the rally.Many of Thailand's wealthy retail investors have been big winners.""I had nearly liquidated all my stock investing during months of the political protest early this year because I was not sure of the situation,"" said Watchara Kaeow-sawang, a high net worth retail investor.

Its most recent acquisition, in October, brought the total spent there to $417 million.Banpu could potentially increase gas production to 200 million cubic feet per day from its current 150 million cubic feet, she said, adding that Banpu is considering ""putting more money on top of the $500 million"" in shale gas.""We are looking only in the northeast Pennsylvania Marcellus play. It is the sweetest spot for shale gas,"" she said, without giving further details.Banpu was encouraged by U.S. President Donald Trump's energy policies favourable to coal and natural gas, she said.In its power generation business, Banpu wants to increase installed capacity from 2,100 megawatts (MW) to 4,300 MW by 2025, Somruedee said. Banpu was looking to invest in Vietnam and was also studying Myanmar, she said.The company reported a surge in profits in the third quarter ending in September thanks to higher coal prices.

The group alleged that Banpu had misinformed the Lao government on the project.Later that year, Banpu won a deal to develop the project when the Lao government reopened bids. Nganthavee's group alleged that Banpu had used the information obtained from their joint venture to win the $3.7 billion project for itself.""The court has ruled that the claim made by the plaintiffs is not rational,"" a judge read the verdict. ""The termination of the contract was the result of the mistake made by the plaintiff, and the defendant has no authority to order the Lao government to terminate the contract.""Banpu shares, which jumped 11 percent last week, dropped 2.2 percent after trading resumed on Tuesday afternoon as the stock traded ex dividend. The overall index .SETI was 0.13 percent lower.The 2012 ruling had helped push Banpu's shares to a four-year low in July last year.BILLIONS OF BAHTUnder a 2012 ruling by a Thai civil court, Banpu and a subsidiary were to pay Nganthavee and his group damages of 4 billion baht ($125 million) with 7.5 percent interest per annum. That was on top of other damages, including compensation for loss of business opportunity, of about 33 billion baht. The group had earlier sought damages totalling 63.5 billion baht.""The Appeal Court decided to dismiss the claim made by the plaintiffs based on the rationale that Banpu had acted in good faith in developing the Hongsa Project both before and after the entering of the related contracts with the plaintiffs,"" Banpu said in a statement.The lawyer of the Nganthavee group said they would consider appealing to a higher court.Banpu, also Indonesia's fourth-largest coal miner, has said the court case would not affect the Hongsa project. The concession is operated by Hongsa Power Co Ltd, a joint venture between Banpu, Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Pcl RATCH.BK and the Lao government.Banpu owns 40 percent of the Hongsa lignite power plant, due to begin operations next year.

But in the longer term, the sector is expected to benefit from demand for funding as the government and private sector invest in infrastructure projects.Shares in Bangkok Bank, valued at $12.5 billion, have risen 9 percent in the past 12 months, underperforming a 14 percent gain on the main Thai index.|0.6679410066471991|0.7966666666666666

1|364|BH|8282014|UPDATE 1-Thailand's Bumrungrad eyes overseas growth as home demand slows|"BANGKOK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Bumrungrad Hospital Pcl BH.BK, Thailand's second-largest hospital operator, is looking for opportunities to expand in Vietnam, Myanmar and China, after a domestic political crisis prompted it to cut its revenue target this year.The high-end hospital operator cut its 2014 revenue growth target to between 7 and 10 percent from 10 to 15 percent, in the wake of months of political unrest, CEO Dennis Brown told reporters on Thursday.The move comes after the company's foreign patients, who account for about 60 percent of revenue, fell 12 percent for outpatients and 8 percent for inpatients in the first half of 2014.""We anticipate ... between 7 to 10 percent growth this year. Normally, we expect 10 to 15 percent growth,"" Brown said, adding that Bumrungrad had began foreign expansion after Asia's financial crisis in 1997, when domestic demand softened.Myanmar, the company's largest market outside Thailand, accounted for about 7 percent of revenue, while Middle East countries were in the top five in terms of foreign patients.Brown said Bumrungrad has long been keen to invest in China although he was concerned about the availability of doctors because many continued to work with public hospitals.""The biggest problem in China right now is the doctor availability. They recently allowed doctors to practice at more than one location. We have not yet seen doctors moving out from the public sector to the private sector,"" Brown said.China will allow foreign investors to wholly own hospitals in seven cities and provinces, further opening up the country's fast-growing private hospital sector. (Full Story)Vietnam also has a problem about availability of doctors, while Myanmar needed to develop infrastructure, he said without giving details about needed investment.Bumrungrad, which acquired a 41 percent stake in a hospital in Mongolia in March, has cash of about 6 billion baht and has set a budget of about 600 million baht a year to spend on equipment replacement and new machines, he said.Healthcare spending in southeast Asia is expected to rise in the long term, driven by growing populations, higher incomes and ageing people, Brown said.The population above 65 years old in southeast Asia is forecast to reach 36 million by 2020, from 25 million in 2010, analysts have said, adding Thai hospitals are likely to benefit from steady demand for medical tourism in Thailand.($1 = 31.88 Baht)* Cut 2014 revenue growth target to 7-10 pct from 10-15 pct* Myanmar is largest market outside Thailand"|0.7599674971979382|0.9266666666666666

It targeted annual revenue and profit growth of 25 percent over the next five years.Outside of Bangkok transit, BTS and its partners would bid for the government's $7.2 billion high-speed rail project linking three airports. They were waiting to review terms of the project before considering additional partners.

(Full Story)At the time, Dhanin promised investors to more than halve CP ALL's leverage - its net debt to EBITDA ratio - to just above 3 times by 2017 from an estimated 8 times, the highest among all food and staples companies in Asia, Thomson Reuters data show.He hoped to do that by adding 500-600 stores a year, but that expansion is threatened by Thailand's political fragility and an economic slowdown that have seen the value of the Thai baht THB=TH slide by nearly 14 percent since last April. The government on Tuesday imposed a state of emergency in Bangkok and surrounding provinces to help contain street protests aimed at forcing Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to resign. (Full Story)""There would be three risks,"" said Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, a Singapore-based analyst for Standard Chartered, who rates CP ALL stock as 'underperform'. ""One is the depreciation of the currency; second is the roll-out of new stores may not be as aggressive; and finally, whether same-store sales will measure up to the valuation that the company has.""The political crisis affected domestic consumption in the fourth quarter and would likely drag down retailers' profits from the previous quarter, said Mintra Ratayapas, an analyst at KK Trade Securities. ""Sentiment in the retail sector has already been hit by weak domestic consumption. In Q4, same-stores sales at Big C BIGC.BK and Robinson ROBI.BK were negative; the rest faced slower-than-expected growth,"" she said.This could potentially squeeze Dhanin's efforts to trim his debt load, with some bankers saying he may look to raise equity or sell assets into a property fund.CP ALL shares have fallen more than 11 percent since late last month, but are up by a quarter since hitting 17-month lows last August.Dhanin was not available to comment, but Kriengchai Boonpoapichart, head of finance and investor relations at CP ALL, said: ""We still have great faith in Thailand's future prospects and maintain our target for growth and expansion."""|0.4180467208326431|0.08

The company targets average overall growth at 10-15 percent annually.""In the next five years, Asian demand for protein-rich food will increase as the emerging economies are growing, raising people's income,"" Adirek said at the Summit.""Growth in emerging countries will surpass that of the domestic market. We have seen strong growth potential and that's why we have been aggressive in foreign investments in recent decades.""CPF, which aspires to be the kitchen of the world, has been present in Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia for more than 20 years, as well as in China, India, Russia and Turkey.In Thailand, political unrest has dragged down consumption and slowed growth, but any impact on CPF's growth will be cushioned by foreign operations, Adirek said.Domestic sales growth is likely to average 7 to 8 percent over the next five years compared with 15 percent abroad, he said.CPF, which is also the world's biggest shrimp farmer, plans to raise capacity at its feed, farm and food businesses over the next four years by investing at least 50 billion baht ($1.6 billion), more than 60 percent of which will go into its foreign business.That budget excludes funds for acquisitions though the company is looking for overseas buying opportunities, Adirek said. CPF considered bidding for the U.S.'s Smithfield Foods Inc SFD.N, sold last year to a Chinese company for $4.7 billion.

GPSC first proposed the deal earlier this week. (Full Story)If the same terms were offered to Glow's other shareholders, the remaining stake would be worth another 43.6 billion baht ($1.33 billion). With its own market value around just $3.3 billion, GPSC also unveiled major fund-raising plans including short-term loans as well as new share and bond issues, sending its stock sharply lower in early Bangkok trading.The deal will allow state-backed PTT to nearly triple the size of its power generating arm, expanding capacity to 4,835 megawatts (MW) from GPSC's 1,940 MW. ""This acquisition will enlarge our industrial customer base,"" GPSC Chief Executive Toemchai Bunnag said in the statement announcing the deal.GPSC said it would finance the purchase through short-terms loans of 142.5 billion baht to pay for both the Engie stake and subsequent tender offer. It's also considering issuing up to 74 billion baht of new shares as well as new bonds of up to 68.5 billion baht, pending shareholder approval.Shares in GPSC fell as much as 6 percent in morning trading in Bangkok as investors digested the implications of the fund-raising plan. Shares in Glow were up 1.6 percent, while PTT was 1.5 percent higher.Engie said in a statement that the sale was in line with its aim of reducing coal-fired power assets as part of a strategy of reducing carbon emissions. Proceeds will be reinvested in projects with low carbon emissions.Analysts said the deal made strategic sense for PTT.Glow has high-quality assets strategically located in Thailand's industrial east, CGS-CIMB Securities (Thailand) analyst, Suwat Sinsadok said.Other PTT subsidiaries are already Glow customers, and as industrial zones grow in line with government policy, so will demand for electricity with power plants difficult to build from scratch in those areas, Suwat said."|0.7438708228506108|0.6833333333333333

The military junta, which took power in May, is banking on big infrastructure projects to revive growth.The jump in Land & Houses' investment budget could indicate that many of the delayed projects will be launched in 2015.The $20-billion Thai real estate market, which accounts for about 5 to 6 percent of the country's GDP, is expected to grow at a rate higher than the country's economic growth forecast of 3.0-3.5 percent this year, company President Naporn Sunthornchitcharoen told reporters on Wednesday.""The planned public and private investments should boost the economy and restore confidence in the private sector,"" Naporn said, adding demand should improve especially in the provinces although there could be speculation in the condominium segment.The sector's registration of new houses and condominiums fell 3.2 percent in 2014 after months of domestic political unrest, he said.Land & Houses planned to spend 8 billion baht to buy land and another 4 billion to buy properties for rent, Managing Director Adisorn Thananan-narapool told reporters.

1|1171|MINT|6062018|UPDATE 1-Thailand's Minor plans 2.5 billion euro takeover bid for Spain's NH Hotels|MADRID, June 5 (Reuters) - Thailand-based Minor International MINT.BK said on Tuesday it plans to launch a takeover bid for NH Hotels NHH.MC valuing the Spanish hotel group at up to 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 billion) after buying a stake from Chinese conglomerate HNA Group.Minor International has agreed to pay HNA, NH's biggest shareholder, 622 million euros for a 26.5 percent stake in the hotel group, subject to certain conditions.After the conversion of some bonds to shares, it would take Minor's stake in NH to around 38 percent, exceeding the 30 percent ownership threshold beyond which Spanish law requires a full takeover be launched.Minor will offer 6.4 euros for each remaining share in NH, it said in a filing with the Spanish market regulator.HNA Group's sale of the NH stake to Minor will take place in two stages. The Chinese firm said it had agreed to sell a 17.64 percent stake in the hotel chain for 6.4 euros per share in a transaction expected to close on June 15.If the first tranche is completed, it would then sell a further 8.83 percent of NH for 6.10 euros per share. This deal is expected to close between Sept. 10 and 16.Minor owns and operates more than 150 hotels and resorts under brands including Four Seasons and Marriott. It started an investment drive in 2016 through which it said it planned to operate 210 hotels by 2020.HNA is restructuring operations and selling assets to raise cash, partly to repay debt.Since the start of 2018, it has agreed to sell over $10 billion of real estate in Australia, New York and Hong Kong, along with shares in Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE, and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc HLT.N.HNA said in January it had hired banks to look for buyers of its stake in NH.HNA had an acrimonious relationship with NH, which ousted the Chinese group's representatives from its board in 2016 after HNA's purchase of a rival hotel group led to accusations of a conflict of interest.NH, which has more than 370 hotels in 30 countries, turned down a takeover offer from Spanish peer Barcelo in January. Barcelo had then considered making an offer for HNA's stake before the deal with Minor was struck, according to media reports. (Full Story)|0.8476197073697697|0.97

The company will use internal cash and debt financing to fund the investment, he said.The firm aims to raise the number of hotels it operates to 210 by 2020 from 145 now, he said, while targeting an increase in the number of its domestic and foreign fast-food outlets to 3,100 by 2020 from 1,851 currently.Minor, which owns stakes in hotels run under the Four Seasons, Marriott and St. Regis brands in Bangkok, as well as Oaks in Australia, is aiming to secure net profit growth of at least 15 to 20 percent a year during 2016-2020, Chaiyapat said, speaking during an earnings presentation.The company said its 2015 net profit jumped 60 percent from a year earlier to 7 billion baht, citing robust growth in the hospitality business and gains from revaluation of investments related to acquisitions in Africa and Australia.Minor, which competes with the likes of Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken owner Yum Brands Inc YUM.N, as well as Central Plaza Hotel PCL CENTEL.BK, has been aggressive in acquisitions overseas seeking to expand high-margin food and hotel businesses. Minor runs Burger King, Sizzler, Swensen's and The Pizza Company outlets across Asia.Revenue from overseas operations will rise to 50 percent of the total amount by 2020 from 45 percent now, Chaiyapat said, adding Minor has temporarily closed some restaurants in Singapore for renovation after weak performance.Despite China's economic slowdown, Minor continues to expand food outlets in the country. But expansion will not be ""as aggressive"" as in the past few years, Chaiyapat said. The firm will focus on cost controls as a means to improve profit in the country, where sales rose 24 percent last year.The executive said the company is also looking for opportunities to expand the Tivoli brand internationally.

PTT increased the ratio even as falling oil prices and losses from fuel subsidies pushed Thailand's biggest listed company to post its worst-ever quarterly loss.Like Woodside, PTT has become a high-yielding energy play with its generous dividend payouts. The high ratio is to assure shareholders, CFO Wirat Uanarumit told Reuters on Friday. Major stakeholders - the finance ministry and state-run Vayupak Fund - will get 21 billion baht ($639.66 million) in dividends, according to Thomson Reuters calculations based on their shareholdings. The payout is timely as Thailand's military government prepares to revive the economy with a bout of infrastructure spending.Given widespread expectations the oil price slide is bottoming out, analysts say PTT's payout ratio has probably peaked, though much depends on the company's priorities. PTT says it spends most of its profits on expansion at home and overseas to secure energy supplies, because the government does not have a policy of allocating part of its budget to acquire energy resources.

About one quarter of those supplies are piped in from Myanmar, although those contracts are winding down and Thailand's neighbour is expected to use more of its natural gas resources for its own development.The plans for the increase in LNG import volumes to 5 million tonnes a year come after PTT, Thailand's only gas supplier, cut LNG targets last year as demand slowed after months of domestic political unrest.""There's still a downside risk to our LNG import target for this year, and it could fall to just 3 million tonnes, due to a weak domestic economy and poor gas demand overall,"" PTT CEO Pailin Chuchottaworn told reporters.PTT was on Thursday taking delivery of a 90,000-tonne cargo of LNG from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited, the first shipment in a 20-year contract to import 2 million tonnes a year from the Middle Eastern nation, a company statement said.Thailand's imports of LNG last year came in around 2 million tonnes, only partially using PTT's $880 million Map Ta Phut LNG facility in the eastern province of Rayong.That import terminal has a capacity of 5 million tonnes a year, and PTT is building a second LNG terminal at the same site and of the same capacity, with completion expected in 2017.As it prepares for falling imports from Myanmar and declining domestic output from the Gulf of Thailand, PTT is also studying a plan to build an LNG receiving terminal adjacent to a gas pipeline linked to gas fields in Myanmar.Such a site on the coast of Myanmar would offer a more convenient delivery point for LNG from Middle East suppliers.PTT CEO Pailin said the price of the first Qatar Gas cargo was attractive, close to the $10 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) that PTT pays for natural gas from Myanmar.The Qatar Gas contract is linked to global oil prices, and CEO Pailin expects LNG delivery costs to fall under $10 per mmBtu over the next one or two months.PTT expected to conclude talks soon to buy up to 2.3 milliontonnes a year of LNG from Anadarko Petroleum Corp's APC.N planned export plant in Mozambique, Pailin also told reporters.

1|1659|SAWAD|6262015|Defying weak Thai economy, Krungthai Card, Srisawad shine in consumer finance|"BANGKOK, June 26 (Reuters) - In a country saddled with one of the highest household debts in Southeast Asia, Thailand's top consumer finance lenders Krungthai Card (KTC) and Srisawad Power 1979 are reporting double-digit profit growth and soaring share prices in the stock market.While the country's banking sector is undergoing low growth due to a weak economy and rising provisions of non-performing loans (NPLs), KTC and Srisawad's first-quarter net profits jumped 62 percent and 49 percent, respectively. Their stocks have also more than doubled over the past 12 months, outperforming peers and the wider Thai market.Their profits have remained robust partly because of their already ample loan-loss reserves. Higher provisioning would have eroded their bottom line. As a percentage of NPLs, KTC's loan-loss reserves were at 375 percent in the first quarter compared with 180-200 percent three years ago. Srisawad was at 62 percent. KTC, in particular, has centred its strategy on cost-cutting and better management of its debt collection units since 2012, helping cut its NPLs to 2.4 percent of lending from more than 5 percent three years ago. Srisawad is also targeting low-income clients who typically have a harder time getting loans from big banks.""KTC has a highly efficient debt collection system. Given the current strong NPL coverage of more than 300 percent, higher than its peers, KTC does not need to have more provisions,"" said Adisorn Mungparnchon, a Bangkok-based analyst at Phillip Securities. ""Earnings growth should remain strong in the longer term, and the company also plans to launch a marketing campaign to expand its customer base.""KTC, along with some leasing firms, is also likely to benefit from lower funding costs after the central bank cut its policy rate earlier this year. The companies' lending rates are fixed while they borrow at floating rates, analysts say. When borrowing rates fall, their margins increase. That said, higher leverage means households are more sensitive to macroeconomic weakness. Any sharp deterioration in the economy will expose consumer finance lenders to the prospect of more delinquencies and test their bad-loans buffers."|0.7014416417359938|0.8833333333333333

That missed the average 11.7 billion baht estimate in a Reuters survey of three analysts.The decline in profits was due to marketing expenses relating to getting more customers to use mobile and digital banking services, it said in a statement.Last month, the country's largest banks said they would waive fees for digital transactions, a major source of non-interest income as customers turned to non-banking alternatives for payments and transfers.

It now has more than 11,000 insurance advisors and over 1.1 million customers in Asia.In its most recent Asian deal, FWD agreed in November to buy American International Group Inc's AIG.N Japan life insurance business AIG Fuji Life Insurance Company Ltd for an undisclosed sum.

Prudential, AIA and Manulife declined comment.Thailand caps foreign companies' stakes in domestic insurance ventures at 49 percent, but lawyers said Thailand recently amended its rules to allow foreign insurers to seek government permission to own more than 49 percent or up to a 100 percent shareholding in a Thai insurer.Bangkok-based law firm Tilleke & Gibbins said in a note last week that the move is a significant reform for Thailand's life insurance industry, following liberalisation of the country's non-life insurance sector in recent years.GLOBAL INSURERSSCB's deal is expected to include rights for a buyer to sell insurance products through the bank's 1,200 branch network. The so-called bancassurance model is lucrative for banks as global insurers are willing to pay hefty fees for access to lenders' branch networks and for exposure to a rapidly growing middle class in developing markets, such as Thailand.SCB Life is ranked fourth in Thailand's life insurance market, with Muang Thai Life Assurance Public Co the market leader.Other major players are AIA, France's AXA , which has a deal with Krung Thai Bank , and Thai Life Insurance.Southeast Asia is seen as a growth region for foreign insurers, who are attracted by relatively faster growth rates of life premiums and the region's low insurance penetration.The Thai Life Assurance Association said this month that total premium income in the country grew 5.4 percent from January to November 2016, to 508 billion baht ($14.4 billion). Analysts expect strong growth.""The Thai economy is expected to grow and there's more savings coming out as well, so things are looking better than before,"" said Rajnish Juta, who looks after Southeast Asia insurance services at Deloitte & Touche.""I would look at Thailand and Indonesia as the ones where companies will be looking for growth.

2|1732|SCB|9022014|Siam Commercial Bank in talks to sell 25 percent stake in insurance unit: sources|HONG KONG/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Siam Commercial Bank SCB.BK, Thailand's third-largest lender, is in talks to sell a 25 percent stake in its life insurance business SCB Life Assurance PCL SCBLIF.BK, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.Siam Commercial Bank is mostly in discussions with Japanese insurers, although no deal is imminent, they added, declining to be identified as the plans were confidential. The stake sale could fetch about $600 million based on SCB Life's current market value of $2.4 billion.SCB Life is ranked No.5 in the Thai life insurance market with a share of 10 percent. Siam Commercial has said it wanted to de-list SCB Life from the stock exchange because the free float of stock is less than 5 percent.It is not immediately clear whether Siam Commercial plans to issue new shares or sell its own stake in the life insurance business. The bank owns 94.7 percent stake in SCB Life.Siam Commercial declined to comment.Rising personal income in Asia is giving, for the first time in many cases, individuals and families the ability to afford insurance. That new demand has boosted stock prices and corporate valuations, culminating in a spate of M&A transactions in the industry in the past four years.Foreign companies are attracted to Thailand's under-penetrated insurance market and aging population, Fitch Ratings said in a recent report last month.To tap into that growth, Japanese insurers, British insurer Prudential PRU.L, Canada's Sun Life Financial Inc SLF.TO among others have turned aggressive buyers of Southeast Asian financial services firms as they battle sluggish growth at home.Last year, Japan's Meiji Yasuda Insurance Co bought a 15 percent stake in unlisted Thai Life Insurance Co for about $700 million, beating Sumitomo Life Insurance Co and a raft of other private equity bidders, Reuters previously reported.Siam Commercial's planned sale comes three years after it bought out New York Life from a life insurance joint venture for 8.4 billion baht ($262 million).SCB Life competes with top three rivals AIA Group Ltd 1299.HK, Muang Thai Life Assurance MTI.BK and unlisted Thai Life Insurance. It reported a net profit of 3.1 billion baht in the first half, up 30 percent from a year earlier.Despite domestic political unrest, the Thai life insurance market posted strong growth with first-half premiums rising 19 percent from a year earlier to 256 billion baht, according to data from Thai Life Assurance Association.Competition is expected to intensify in the second half when insurers plans launch new product launches to attract clients.SCB Life has an embedded value of 30.419 billion baht at the end of 2013, and some analysts expect the business to be valued at between 2-2.5 times embedded value.Embedded value is a popular gauge used in insurance M&A.

0|1737|SCB|4142014|Thais brace for recession as crisis nears crunch time|"BANGKOK (Reuters) - The golden Buddha statues, amulets and lucky charms that festoon Sakuntala Mettawong's tiny Bangkok cellphone shop are not helping business.It's peak time, but customers are scarce at the usually bustling mobile phone bazaar in the MBK Center, which sits on the fringe of a mile-long cluster of gleaming malls that symbolise the rapid growth of Thailand's consumer class.""Business has been very bad. Many shops have left here, some moved to find cheaper spots or changed hands,"" said Sakuntala, almost drowned out by the noise of bored shop owners playing computer games behind her.""The top phone models are more difficult to sell ... more people are selling their phones back to shops, to use simple ones, or sell because they need money.""An economy known for its dynamism is ailing, headed towards recession and held hostage by another crippling bout of turmoil in an eight-year power struggle being fought in Bangkok's commercial heart and in its politicized courts.The intractable crisis centres on the political dominance of the billionaire Shinawatra family, and the slim prospect of a resolution has been sapping consumer confidence, which sank in February to a 12 and a half-year low.Economists say five months of sporadic violence and anti-government blockades that have scared off tourists could cost 300 billion baht ($9.3 billion) in lost revenue.Some businesses fear the Teflon coating on what's for years been one of Asia's most resilient economies could finally be wearing off.""Consumers have no mood to spend. We've seen demand falling in every segment of our products,"" said Boonkiat Chokwatana, chairman of consumer product distributor I.C.C. International Pcl, which saw first-quarter sales fall 20 percent.""In more than 43 years in business, we've never needed to cut our costs, even during the 1997 financial crisis. This year the situation is quite critical.""With legal cases stacking up against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, the confrontation pitting royalists, tycoons and scions tied with the old and new political orders against each other could get much worse.Yingluck's mostly rural, working class supporters are convinced powerful forces in Thailand's establishment are conspiring to overthrow her, most likely via a court ruling, and they have vowed to fight back.The outlook for the economy looks just as grim, with some economists forecasting growth of less than 2 percent or even contraction if growth of exports, worth 60 percent of gross domestic product, falls short of the 4.5 percent forecast by the central bank.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) last week projected growth of 2.5 percent this year, the slowest among Asian economies and less than the 2.7 percent seen by the Bank of Thailand following two revisions since October, when tension resurfaced.Thailand's credit-hungry consumers are paying the price, with household debt at the end of 2013 hitting a record at 82.3 percent of GDP, compared with 77.3 percent a year earlier and 45 percent a decade ago.""We're not aggressive on loan growth this year,"" said Siam Commercial Bank president Kannikar Chalitaporn. ""We'll offer (clients) any assistance to prevent loans from turning into bad debt.""The Thai Industries Sentiment Index in February hit its lowest since July 2009, interest in buying property is at its lowest in almost nine years, while domestic auto sales dropped nearly 45 percent in February from a year earlier, after a similar drop in January.RECESSION LOOMING?The central bank has cut the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.0 percent, the lowest since December 2010, and expects the economy to shrink in the first quarter. If that trend continues for another quarter, Thailand would be in recession for the first time since early 2009.""There's a huge risk of technical recession in Thailand,"" said Gundy Cahyadi, an economist at DBS Bank in Singapore.""Export growth remains the only support right now, but this alone can't hold up the economy for too long.""Central bank chief Prasarn Trairatvorakul last week said a big rate cut wouldn't help the economy plagued by both a lack of confidence and a policy vacuum.Parliament remains empty after a February 2 election was disrupted, leaving Yingluck heading a caretaker government.The Constitutional Court has not helped. It has ruled consistently against Yingluck's party, annulled an election it probably won and declared illegal a 2 trillion baht ($62 billion) infrastructure spending plan.The Board of Investment says projects worth about 660 billion baht have been on ice, awaiting approval by a new committee the caretaker government has been unable to appoint.The government is at its weakest and any administration that replaces it is almost certain to face the same kind of opposition, meaning many more months of weak business for retailers, the tourism sector and exporters.Hotel occupancy has been hovering at about 50 percent, down from the usual 80 percent and exports grew just 0.2 percent in the first two months compared with a year earlier.TISCO Bank Pcl cut its forecast for domestic car sales this year to about 900,000 vehicles from 1.1 million-1.2 million, even with a host of zero-interest loans offered by car dealers.Some Thai companies are looking to expand abroad. Handset distributor Jay Mart Pcl said it may revise its target of 35 percent growth this year and aimed to tap high demand in neighbouring Myanmar, as Thailand's appetite for top-end smartphones sags.According to market research group Gfk, consumers have been choosing cheaper models from Nokia and iMobile since the protests began, with Apple's sales down from 127,000 units in November to 100,600 in February.""People are in the mood for shopping,"" said Kridchanok Patamasatayasonthi, managing director of homes and furniture firm Index Living Mall.""They don't know what's going to happen, or whether we're going to have riots in the city ... they want to make sure they don't overspend right now.""(This story has been refiled to add dropped words in paragraph 18)"|0.45899410741764834|0.22333333333333333

That compares with the annual growth it projects in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) of 7 percent to 8 percent.""If political crisis is prolonged, Thai cement demand is likely to be negative,"" Chief Executive Kan Trakulhoon said at the Reuters ASEAN Summit on Thursday.""ASEAN will be a growth platform for the world economy. Its attractiveness has increased significantly after Myanmar was included,"" Kan said at the summit.Myanmar is emerging from decades of military rule and isolating sanctions and has been looking to attract foreign investment since a quasi-civilian government took office in 2011. This year, the country is chairing ASEAN for the first time.Siam Cement's ASEAN assets reached $2.2 billion last year, or 16 percent of the total from 5 percent in 2008. The company aims for ASEAN sales to reach 30 percent from 20 percent by 2018, Kan said.ASEAN is made up of Thailand and the hosts of its three new factories, plus Brunei, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam.Siam Cement aims to begin production at the new factories over the next two years, raising overall capacity by 20 percent from 24 million tonnes now, Kan said.The company then plans to double capacity in Indonesia and Myanmar within five years of beginning production, Kan said.""We are investing more in ASEAN and less in Thailand, where we focus on high value-added products,"" Kan said.Capital expenditure could be as high as 60 billion baht ($1.84 billion) this year, beyond the 40 billion baht to 50 billion baht range previously announced, Kan said.

1|1816|SCC|7302013|Thailand's Siam Cement profits from Southeast Asia demand|"BANGKOK, July 31 (Reuters) - Siam Cement Pcl SCC.BK, Thailand's largest industrial conglomerate, is finally catching up with the capacity it overbuilt before the Asian financial crisis as it feeds demand from frontier markets including Myanmar and Cambodia.The company's rapid growth is emblematic of Southeast Asia's rise, where countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand currently rank among the world's strongest economies.With that economic growth comes demand for the building and packaging materials that Siam Cement makes.At the height of the Asian financial crisis in 1998, Thailand used less than 60 percent of its cement capacity, which peaked at 56 million tonnes, far outstripping demand.Capacity has held steady since then, but now as much as 90 percent is used, and Siam Cement plans to expand its production capability in 2015, which would be the first increase since the 1990s.Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos have a cement shortage and must import supplies, while demand in Indonesia and Thailand - Southeast Asia's two biggest economies - is expected to rise 10 percent this year because of big infrastructure projects.Siam Cement, the region's second-largest cement maker after Swiss company Holcim Ltd HOLN.VX, is expected to report later on Wednesday that second-quarter net profit doubled, which would bring the first-half earnings growth to 70 percent, according to eight analysts surveyed by Reuters.For the full year, analysts expect a 39 percent rise in net profit to 32.9 billion baht ($1.05 billion), which would be the highest since 2010.Indonesian rival Semen Indonesia Tbk SMGR.JK reported a 23 percent increase in first-half net profit on Tuesday.(Full Story)While Thai companies including top oil and gas company PTT Pcl PTT.BK have scaled back investment after a slump in Southeast Asian exports, Siam Cement maintained its five-year capital spending budget at 200 billion baht ($6.43 billion) as part of its drive to capture growth around the region.""Our investments will focus on Indonesia, Vietnam and Myanmar, which are our strategic countries,"" Chief Executive Kan Trakulhoon told Reuters in a recent interview.The Thai firm's investments reached 47 billion baht ($1.51 billion) in 2012, the most since 1997 when capital spending hit a record high of 61.3 billion baht.Its net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, a measure of gearing, stood at 2.7 at the end of March, compared with 9.2 at the end of 1997.The company plans to raise its domestic capacity by 10 percent in 2015, when new cement plants in Indonesia, Cambodia and Myanmar will also gradually come on stream.Smaller domestic rivals such as second-ranked Siam City Cement Pcl SCCC.BK, part owned by Holcim, and No. 3 TPI Polene Pcl TPIP.BK also plan to boost domestic capacity after working through the oversupply.FLOOD RECOVERYThailand's cement demand recovered from severe floods in late 2011, recording 12.8 percent growth in 2012.Growth is expected to continue next year despite a possible delay in an $11 billion water management programme and $70 billion worth of infrastructure projects.New home construction and renovations have helped pick up the slack, and Siam Cement's plants in the central and northern parts of Thailand have been running at full capacity.Domestic cement sales in May rose 11.8 percent year-on-year.Residential projects normally make up half of cement demand and infrastructure takes up about 20 percent.Siam Cement shares, valued at $17 billion, have outperformed the Thai market, up 42 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 23 percent gain for the broader Thai market .SETI.According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, 19 of 21 analysts covering the stock rate Siam Cement ""buy"" or ""strong buy"" with the other two advising clients to ""sell"".The question mark hanging over the company is whether the strong Southeast Asian demand will last once the U.S. Federal Reserve begins scaling back its bond-buying programme, which has sent a wave of cheap money into emerging markets.As borrowing costs rise, big infrastructure projects become more expensive.But for now, Thailand's cement sector is in the sweet spot.""Thailand has more room to capture demand as it is in the early years of a strong growth cycle.In the next three years, it should be a golden period for the cement sector after a downturn in the past decade,"" said Suwat Sinsadok, an analyst at CIMB Securities in Bangkok."|0.6671600570580006|0.8933333333333333

Its outstanding auto hire purchase portfolio is expected to be worth 350 billion baht ($10 billion) this year, close to last year's, Somjate said.Most other Thai banks are also aiming for moderate loan growth this year.As part of the partnership with Mazda, the bank and the automaker will launch a joint marketing campaign to attract car buyers and Thanachart Bank will provide financing for the automaker to increase its number of showrooms in Thailand.The bank may also run Mazda's payroll system in the future and provide loans to Mazda dealers, it said.Thanachart Bank, which specialises in auto leasing, is 49 percent owned by Scotiabank and 51 percent by Thai financial group Thanachart Capital Pcl .Scotiabank has been looking to divest its stake in Thanachart Bank, sources have said, although a domestic media report this week said the plan was now on hold.

(Full Story)The PTT group has already cut its investment budget to minimise the impact of the fall in oil prices, while PTTEP has delayed new investments in three foreign projects in Canada, Australia and Myanmar, Somporn said.PTTEP has also cut its five-year investment plan to $11 billion from $15 billion and cost cutting measures will also help it cope with the volatility in oil prices, he said.Tevin Vongvanich, Chief Executive of PTT, said on Tuesday he believed PTT ""can survive"" if oil prices drop to $20-$30 a barrel given the group's strong financial position and no commitment on new projects.State-controlled PTT set an investment budget for 2016 at 50.8 billion baht and the company is on track to double the capacity of its 5-million-tonner per year liquefied natural gas import terminal in eastern Rayong, Tevin said.PTT, the country's sole gas supplier, is also looking at building a second LNG terminal with annual capacity of 7.5 million tonnes and a floating LNG storage vessel, Tevin said adding PTT aimed to buy more LNG from the spot market after price declines.PTT, which buys 30 percent of its LNG on the spot markets,expects oil prices this year to average $42 a barrel compared with $40 in 2015, he said.Meanwhile PTT refiner Thai Oil is examining a plan to upgrade its 275,000 barrel-per-day refinery and boost the capacity to 400,000 bpd by 2021 at an estimated cost of $3-4 billion, Chief Executive Atikom Terbsiri said.The upgrade will involve plans to turn fuel oil into diesel and use more naphtha as feedstock to produce paraxylen products, Atikom said, adding the company will make a final decision on the project in late 2016."|0.5814592113519471|0.22333333333333333

The licences have a 15-year lifetime.True Corp shares rose as much as 8.1 percent on Friday after its announcement, before ending the day 5.9 percent higher.""Investors have positive sentiment for True not making an expensive investment,"" said Pisut Ngamvijitvong, an analyst at Kasikorn Securities.Shares of Thailand's third-ranked mobile operator DTAC, which is 43 percent owned by Norway's Telenor Group TEL.OL, surged as much as 7.3 percent.Just a day earlier, DTAC had said it was considering bidding in the auction. It had earlier criticised the terms of the auction, calling them ""out of step"" with industry needs, but some analysts said it needed the spectrum as its current spectrum licence is set to expire in September.Ratings agency Fitch has said securing the 1800-Mhz spectrum was ""crucial"" for DTAC because the company had lost market share due to spectrum inferiority.With True vacating the field, DTAC's chances of winning spectrum have improved, boosting its shares, said some analysts.""DTAC could be the sole bidder in August,"" said Pisut of Kasikorn Securities.Thailand's largest mobile operator Advanced Info Service Pcl ADVANC.BK has not yet said whether it will bid or not. Its shares climbed as much as 2.2 percent on Friday.Some analysts said Friday's gains in shares of the three mobile operators were also partly fuelled by hopes that the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), which set the auction terms, will ease them after True's exit to facilitate a competitive process.""We will proceed with the auction even if there is one bidder,"" NBTC Secretary-General Takorn Tantasith said in statement, responding to True's announcement."|0.49015064959061244|0.21666666666666667

The warning required Thailand to clean up in six months or face a trade ban.A spokesman for the European Commission confirmed that no formal decision had yet been taken and said the next round of talks would take place in Bangkok in July.A Thai team visited Brussels last week to discuss progress. Since receiving the EU warning, Thailand has instigated new licence and monitoring systems for fishing vessels, the director general of the Thai Fisheries Department, Adisorn Promthep, told Reuters last week in Brussels.Bangkok has also tightened regulations and imposed limitations on the catch, Adisorn said.The EU yellow card had been a ""wakeup call"" to deal with an obsolete fisheries law, he added.Authorities were also making more regular checks on vessels and demanded employers give workers written contracts, he said. That was to prevent labour abuses and human traffickers selling people on to boats, Adisorn said."|0.506927740818357|0.28

A scandal over corporate governance erupted in December when one of the country's largest companies, CP All , kept executives in their positions after the SEC fined them record amounts for insider trading.On Wednesday, the SEC fined executives at Bangkok Insurance Pcl , WHA Corporation Pcl and Siam Global House Pcl for insider trading and other violations of market regulations.The SEC said it had fined Siam Global House Chairman Witoon Suriyawanakul 24.3 million baht ($694,000) for using insider information to profit from purchases of ordinary shares and warrants in the company.Three others in the Suriyawanakul family were fined 333,333 baht each for the same offence, the SEC said. Siam Global House is a building material retailer.The SEC filed a criminal complaint against two others -- Surasak Chuntori and Ekkamon Chuntori -- for allegedly using insider information to purchase Siam Global shares as they refused to participate in the SEC's fining process.The chairman of Bangkok Insurance Chai Sophonpanich was fined for disclosing a proposed dividend to people who then purchased BKI shares, the SEC said.Bangkok Insurance is 9.97 percent owned by Bangkok Bank , also founded by the Sophonpanich family.The SEC banned Chai from taking executive roles in financial sector companies for three years.At industrial estate developer WHA Corp, Chief Executive Somyos Anantaprayoon was fined for making pubic that the company was negotiating a takeover before he disclosed that information to the Stock Exchange of Thailand, the SEC said.WHA is Thailand's biggest industrial estate developer by market value.

1|2084|WHA|10312013|RPT-WHA's Investment in Solar Panel Project will not impact ratings|Oct 31 (Reuters) - (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Fitch Ratings (Thailand) Limited says WHA Corporation Public Company Limited's WHA.BK (WHA; A-(tha)/Stable/F2(tha)) investment in Thailand's Solar PV Rooftop project is not likely to affect the company's credit metrics while the cash inflow to WHA from the investment is unlikely to be significant over the next three to four years.Thailand's state utilities have agreed to purchase up to 8.52 megawatts of solar power from WHA's joint ventures taking part in the Ministry of Energy's Solar PV Rooftop program, in which households and commercial operators submit proposals to sell electricity generated by solar photovoltaic (PV) panels on their roof tops to state utilities.WHA's stake in each joint venture is about 75%. According to the company, the total project cost for 8.52 megawatts is about THB600m, which will be financed at the joint ventures with no recourse to their shareholders. WHA expects the joint ventures to have debt-to-equity ratios of 3:1. WHA's estimated investment in these joint ventures is about THB113m and it does not expect significant additional capital injection. In Fitch's view, this investment amount is not likely to have significant impact on its financial leverage.Although WHA holds 75% stakes in the joint ventures, Fitch will deconsolidate debt and operating cash flows of these joint ventures when analyzing WHA's credit metrics. This is because the projects are likely to be financed by project loans, which means the first priority of the joint ventures' cash flows is to service the obligations under the project loans. Therefore, WHA has less control over the cash flows of the joint ventures. Additionally, WHA says the project loans have no recourse to support from WHA, should the joint ventures fail to make payments. If substantial funding is subsequently provided by WHA to the joint ventures, Fitch would re-assess the non-recourse nature of the structure and may potentially consolidate (fully or partially) the joint venture liabilities on WHA's balance sheet for the purposes of its analysis.The contribution from the joint ventures to WHA, which will be taken into our consideration in analyzing WHA's credit metrics, is dividend payment. Fitch believes the joint ventures are unlikely to make dividend payments for the first three to four years of the projects.|0.8164007854221982|0.91

(Full Story)Chairman Chutinant Bhirombhakdi told Reuters in an interview on Thursday there was more to come.""We are somewhat a late-comer to property development,"" he said, adding Boon Rawd and its partners had a good land bank and so the time was right to diversify beyond beverages.Boon Rawd is best known for making Thailand's Singha beer, and is owned by the Bhirombhakdi family, which is ranked the 9th richest in the country.Singha Estate is focused on Thailand’s real estate sector, where it is an upscale developer, with 58 percent of revenue in its second quarter coming from residential properties.However, it wants to balance its portfolio with commercial property and office space, said Chutinant, who is also executive vice president at Boon Rawd.There is still demand from foreign companies setting up shop in Bangkok where scattered business districts are soon to be linked by an extended mass transport system, he added.Chutinant said assets and properties in Europe on the whole were ""available at a discount, and interesting,” but did not give specifics.He was also confident about the tourist industry because there was “no substitute.”“People will still have to go see the Colosseum in Rome, Stonehenge in England, and islands in the Maldives,” he said.Singha Estate has over 3,000 hotel rooms in the United Kingdom, while the first phase of its development across three islands in the Maldives is due to be ready for visitors in the third quarter of next year.The company is looking to increase its number of hotel rooms, Chutinant said, adding he would like to see 30 percent of Singha Estate's revenue come from overseas versus less than 20 percent now, though he noted this was not an official target.On other areas of diversification for Boon Rawd, Chutinant said the business would expand its food and packaging units.It also plans to expand into neighboring Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar in “a big way,” he added, without giving details. Boon Rawd bought two units of Vietnamese consumer goods giant Masan in 2015 for $1.1 billion.Alcoholic beverages account for 75 percent of Boon Rawd’s business. Boon Rawd President Santi Bhirombhakdi, who is Chutinant’s cousin, has said he wants to see 30-35 percent of revenue coming from other businesses."|0.8073312113192832|0.96
